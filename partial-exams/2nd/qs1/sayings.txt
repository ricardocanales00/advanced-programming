a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
a friend in need is a friend indeed
a stitch in time (saves nine)
absence makes the heart grow fonder
all that glitters is not gold
as you sow, so shall you reap
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
love is blind
better late than never
better safe than sorry 
brain is better than brawn
don't count your chickens (before they're hatched)
every cloud has a silver lining
half a loaf is better than no bread
he who laughs last laughs longest
if you buy cheaply, you pay dearly
if you keep your mouth shut, you won't put your foot in it
if you want a thing done well, do it yourself?
it's no use crying over spilt milk
it's the early bird that catches the worm
early to bed and early to rise (makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise)
let sleeping dogs lie
look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves
many hands make light work
necessity is the mother of invention
never put off till tomorrow what you can do today
no cows, no cares
one man's meat is another man's poison
out of sight, out of mind
Rome wasn't built in a day
talk of the devil â€¦(and the devil appears)
the best things in life are free
the cure is worse than the cause
the solution is worse than the problem
the cure is worse than the disease
the end justifies the means
the grass is always greener on the other side
there's no time like the present
they that live by the sword shall die by the sword
think before you speak
time is money
to put all your eggs in one basket
to throw the baby out with the bathwater
two heads are better than one
waste not, want not
we all make mistakes
when the cat's away the mice will play
you can lead o take a horse to water but you can't make it drink
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
know what you've got till it's gone
